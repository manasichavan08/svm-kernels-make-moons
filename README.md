# SVM Kernel Comparison on make_moons Dataset 🎯

This project demonstrates how different kernel functions in Support Vector Machines (SVM) affect decision boundaries and classification accuracy using the `make_moons` dataset from scikit-learn.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `SVM_Kernel_Tutorial.ipynb` – Full implementation in Python using sklearn
- `SVM_Kernel_Tutorial_FINAL.pdf` – Tutorial report explaining theory + results
- `plots/` – Contains all decision boundary plots and accuracy chart
- `README.md` – You’re reading it 🙂
- `LICENSE` – MIT license for reuse

## 📌 Kernels Covered

- Linear
- Polynomial (degree=3)
- RBF (Radial Basis Function)
- Sigmoid

Each kernel is evaluated with:
- Decision boundary visualization
- Test accuracy
- Side-by-side performance comparison

## 📊 Dataset Used

- **make_moons** from `sklearn.datasets`
- 200 samples, noise = 0.2
- Scaled using `StandardScaler`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download the notebook
2. Open `SVM_Kernel_Tutorial.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run all cells to reproduce the results and plots
